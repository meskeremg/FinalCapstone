# NLP Book Recommendation System

The purpose of this project is to identify which books are similar based on text analysis of categories and descriptions of the books. The system will take a title of a book that the user read before and liked as an input. Then it will be able to recommend the 5 most similar books to the chosen title.

## Data Files

I was not able to upload the dataset to Github due to size limitations.
However, the original data set can be found on [Kaggle here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews?select=books_data.csv)
